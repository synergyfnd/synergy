# Synergy

A fresh [Substrate](https://www.substrate.io/) node. Let's go!

### Developing

First, complete the [basic Rust setup instructions](./docs/rust-setup.md).

- To run the node: `cargo run --release -- --dev`
- To build the node: `cargo build --release`
- To read docs: `./target/release/node-template -h`

## Run

The provided `cargo run` command will launch a temporary node and its state will be discarded after
you terminate the process. After the project has been built, there are other ways to launch the
node. To purge the development chain's state:

```bash
./target/release/node-template purge-chain --dev
```

To maintain the chain' state between runs, a base path must be added:

```bash
./target/release/node-template --dev --base-path ./my-chain-state/
```

Once the node template is running locally, you can connect it with **Polkadot-JS Apps** front-end
to interact with your chain. [Click
here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer?rpc=ws://localhost:9944) connecting the Apps to your
local node template.

### Useful references

There are several files in the `node` directory - take special note of the following:

- [`chain_spec.rs`](./node/src/chain_spec.rs): A
  [chain specification](https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/build/chain-spec/) is a
  source code file that defines a Substrate chain's initial (genesis) state. Chain specifications
  are useful for development and testing, and critical when architecting the launch of a
  production chain. Take note of the `development_config` and `testnet_genesis` functions, which
  are used to define the genesis state for the local development chain configuration. These
  functions identify some
  [well-known accounts](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/command-line-tools/subkey/)
  and use them to configure the blockchain's initial state.
- [`service.rs`](./node/src/service.rs): This file defines the node implementation. Take note of
  the libraries that this file imports and the names of the functions it invokes. In particular,
  there are references to consensus-related topics, such as the
  [block finalization and forks](https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/fundamentals/consensus/#finalization-and-forks)
  and other [consensus mechanisms](https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/fundamentals/consensus/#default-consensus-models)
  such as Aura for block authoring and GRANDPA for finality.

Review the [FRAME runtime implementation](./runtime/src/lib.rs) included in this template to configure pallets:

- This file configures several pallets to include in the runtime. Each pallet configuration is
  defined by a code block that begins with `impl $PALLET_NAME::Config for Runtime`.
- The pallets are composed into a single runtime by way of the
  [`construct_runtime!`](https://crates.parity.io/frame_support/macro.construct_runtime.html)
  macro, which is part of the core
  FRAME Support [system](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/frame-pallets/#system-pallets) library.

### Pallets

The runtime in this project is constructed using many FRAME pallets that ship with the
[core Substrate repository](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame) and a
template pallet that is [defined in the `pallets`](./pallets/template/src/lib.rs) directory.

A FRAME pallet is compromised of a number of blockchain primitives:

- Storage: FRAME defines a rich set of powerful
  [storage abstractions](https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/build/runtime-storage/) that makes
  it easy to use Substrate's efficient key-value database to manage the evolving state of a
  blockchain.
- Dispatchables: FRAME pallets define special types of functions that can be invoked (dispatched)
  from outside of the runtime in order to update its state.
- Events: Substrate uses [events and errors](https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/build/events-errors/)
  to notify users of important changes in the runtime.
- Errors: When a dispatchable fails, it returns an error.
- Config: The `Config` configuration interface is used to define the types and parameters upon
  which a FRAME pallet depends.
